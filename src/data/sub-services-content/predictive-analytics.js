  faqs: [
    { question: "Do we have enough data for predictive analytics?", answer: "Machine learning requires a decent volume of historical data to find patterns. During our initial consultation, our data scientists will audit your databases to determine if you meet the threshold for accurate forecasting." },
    { question: "What if our data is messy or spread across multiple systems?", answer: "This is very common! The first phase of our process is Data Engineering, where we extract, clean, and consolidate your data into a single 'Source of Truth' data warehouse before applying any AI." },
    { question: "Can we integrate these predictions into our existing software?", answer: "Yes, we deploy our models via secure APIs, meaning the predictions can be piped directly into your CRM, ERP, or custom web applications." },
    { question: "How do you ensure the model stays accurate over time?", answer: "Markets change, which can cause 'model drift'. We set up MLOps pipelines that continuously monitor the model's accuracy and automatically retrain it with fresh data at regular intervals." }
