  faqs: [
    { question: "Can the AI read messy handwriting?", answer: "Yes. While standard OCR struggles with handwriting, modern AI models excel at interpreting handwritten notes, forms, and signatures with high accuracy." },
    { question: "Do documents need to be in a specific template?", answer: "No. Legacy systems required rigid templates. Our LLM-powered approach understands context, meaning it can find 'Total Amount' on an invoice regardless of where it is placed on the page." },
    { question: "What happens if the AI isn't sure about a field?", answer: "We implement a confidence threshold. If the AI is less than 95% confident (configurable), the document is flagged and routed to a simple dashboard for a human to quickly verify." },
    { question: "What languages do you support?", answer: "Our models support over 50 languages, including complex character sets like Arabic, Chinese, and Japanese." }
