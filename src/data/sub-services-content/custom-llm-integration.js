  faqs: [
    { question: "What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?", answer: "RAG is a technique where we connect an LLM to your specific database of documents. When a user asks a question, the system searches your documents first, retrieves the relevant paragraphs, and gives them to the LLM. This forces the AI to base its answer strictly on your data, practically eliminating hallucinations." },
    { question: "Are my company's secrets safe with these models?", answer: "Yes. When using commercial models (like OpenAI via Azure), enterprise contracts ensure your data is never used to train their base models. For extreme security, we can deploy open-source models (like Meta's Llama) entirely on your own private, air-gapped servers." },
    { question: "Do we need to fine-tune a model, or just use RAG?", answer: "For 90% of business use cases (knowledge retrieval, Q&A), RAG combined with good prompt engineering is cheaper, faster, and more accurate than fine-tuning. We generally only recommend fine-tuning if you need the AI to learn a very specific 'style' or format of writing." },
    { question: "Can the AI generate documents in our specific templates?", answer: "Absolutely. We can engineer the system to output responses directly into your company's branded Word, PDF, or Markdown templates." }
