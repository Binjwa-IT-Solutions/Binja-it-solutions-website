/**
 * Resolves the API base URLs for both the browser and the server.
 *
 * In the browser we go through the Next.js rewrites declared in next.config.js
 * (`/hrms-proxy/*` and `/chatbot-proxy/*`) so requests stay same-origin.
 *
 * On the server (RSC render, static generation, ISR revalidation) those rewrites
 * do not exist yet -- the deployment is not serving traffic while it is being
 * built -- so a relative path either fails to parse or hangs until the build
 * times out. Server-side we therefore talk to the upstream origins directly.
 * These must stay in sync with the `rewrites()` targets in next.config.js.
